# sdl-fakeqwerty

This makes it so that your keyboard looks like a US-QWERTY keyboard to Allegro, SDL 1.2, SDL 2.0 and Unity games, while not changing any system settings.  This is ideal for games with difficult or impossible to change keybindings [which get messed up using a non-QWERTY keyboard](./BACKGROUND.md).

This library intercepts SDL's or Xlib's event system in order to rewrite the `sym` to be like what a US-QWERTY keyboard would return using.  When activated on a non-QWERTY keyboard, it means these games will have keyboard shortcuts with the same physical positions as a QWERTY keyboard.  eg: `W A S D` bindings become `Comma A O E` on US-Dvorak, or `Z Q S D` on a French AZERTY keyboard.

This means you no longer have to change keybindings to play a single game, and the remapping is isolated to a single application (window) and automated.

I've mainly tested this with some Introversion games.  It might fix some other games as well.

Key labels shown in game will probably be displayed incorrectly as a result of using this library.

> **Note:** This will only work on Linux systems, as it relies on `LD_PRELOAD` to work.  There is limited support on OSX (Prison Architect).  I don't have interest in porting this code to other platforms.

## Building / compiling the library

### Linux

Install required packages:

```
# Debian, Ubuntu and friends:
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl1.2-dev libx11-dev build-essential

# Fedora, OpenSUSE and friends:
sudo dnf install SDL2-devel SDL-devel libX11-devel '@Development Tools'
```

If you're on an `amd64` (aka `x86_64`, Intel 64), and you want to build the `i686` version of this library (because the game is only built for i686), you'll also need:

```
# Debian, Ubuntu and friends:
sudo apt install gcc-multilib

# Fedora, OpenSUSE and friends:
sudo dnf install glibc-devel.i686 SDL2-devel.i686 SDL-devel.i686 libX11-devel.i686
```

Then to build:

```
# Build amd64 version of the library:
make amd64

# Build i686 version of the library:
make i686
```

You can also build just the `amd64` (aka `x86_64`, Intel 64) version with `make amd64`, and build just the `i686` (aka `x86_32`) version with `make i686`.

### OSX

> Note: OSX support is experimental and incomplete. This currently only works with Prison Architect.

You'll need Homebrew and XCode installed.

Install required packages:

```
brew install sdl2
```

Then to build:

```
make osx
```

## Setting up

See [the games list](./games/README.md).

## Other games

These instructions are specific to things on Steam.

### Linux

This library works with games which dynamically link to SDL 1.2, SDL 2.0 or Xlib.  It doesn't matter if the game supplies its own version of libSDL.so.  This won't work with games which statically link SDL.

In order to determine which version is in use, use `ldd`.

For example, this game uses SDL 2.0, with a library which ships with the game:

```
$ ldd ./exampleGameBinary | grep -i sdl
	libSDL2-2.0.so.0 => /mnt/raid1/SteamLibrary/SteamApps/common/example/./lib64/libSDL2-2.0.so.0 (0x0000xxxxxxxxxxxx)
```

This game uses SDL 1.2:

```
$ ldd ./exampleGameBinary | grep -i sdl
	libSDL-1.2.so.0 => /mnt/raid1/SteamLibrary/SteamApps/common/example/./lib/libSDL-1.2.so.0 (0xf7xxxxxx)
```

There is also an xlib version which can be used as a fallback for games with other engines (eg: Allegro and Unity).

You then need to figure out what architecture the game runs on, which can be done with `file`.

Once you know this, copy the appropriate `*-hooks-*.so` file into the game's folder, and then edit the game's launch options in Steam.  For example, this will run the game with the SDL 2.0 hooks for amd64:

```
LD_PRELOAD="./sdl2-hooks-amd64.so" %COMMAND%
```

Alternatively, you can use a shell script to wrap the game's binary.

### OSX

Steam on OSX appears to support neither [the `%COMMAND%` options that the Linux client does](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/5548), nor the `LSEnvironment` attribute, so you need a startup script like:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd "${0%/*}"
DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE=1 DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/local/lib/sdl2-hooks.dylib ./Example "$@"
```

Currently only the SDL2 library has been set up for OSX support.

There may be some issues with the `rpath` on other games.  But this may be difficult to address in a generic way.

## License

This code is released under the _same_ open source licenses as SDL:

* **zlib** for `helper.h`, `sdl2-hooks.c` and `xlib-hooks.c` (see `COPYING-sdl2.txt`)
* **LGPLv2.1 or later** for `sdl1-hooks.c` (see `COPYING-sdl1.2.txt`)

Each file has headers which indicate which license that particular code is shared under.

### An extra special note for unscrupulous game publishers

Some [unscrupulous game publishers][paradox] believe that they are entitled to additional rights and impose additional restrictions on "mods" released by third parties without compensation.

We believe such clauses to be excessively broad, predatory, unethical and ultimately unenforceable, especially for `sdl-fakeqwerty`:

1. `sdl-fakeqwerty` contains **no** game-specific functionality, and incorporates no code or assets from those games. There is no requirement to use this software with a game -- only that it dynamically links SDL and/or Xlib.

2. `sdl-fakeqwerty` is intended to correct a defect which limits utility of software that uses SDL and/or Xlib, and is not a "mod" of a specific game.

3. `sdl-fakeqwerty` may be considered a derivative work of SDL or Xorg; in such a case it is likely impossible to grant unencumbered rights or privileges over this work in the way that many "mod policies" would demand in excess of its existing licenses.

Owing to the above points, _even in the case that [this tool supports a game](./games/prison_architect.md) now published by such a publisher:_

* **no additional rights** to this work are granted to such publishers, other than what is granted under this software's regular licenses.

* **no additional restrictions** are accepted from such publishers -- even in the case they may not be contravened today.

* **we believe such clauses to be entirely unenforceable.**
