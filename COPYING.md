## License

This code is released under the _same_ open source licenses as SDL:

* **zlib** for `helper.h`, `sdl2-hooks.c` and `xlib-hooks.c` (see `COPYING-sdl2.txt`)
* **LGPLv2.1 or later** for `sdl1-hooks.c` (see `COPYING-sdl1.2.txt`)

Each file has headers which indicate which license that particular code is shared under.

### An extra special note for unscrupulous game publishers

Some [unscrupulous game publishers][paradox] believe that they are entitled to additional rights and impose additional restrictions on "mods" released by third parties without compensation.

We believe such clauses to be excessively broad, predatory, unethical and ultimately unenforceable, especially for `sdl-fakeqwerty`:

1. `sdl-fakeqwerty` contains **no** game-specific functionality, and incorporates no code or assets from those games. There is no requirement to use this software with a game -- only that it dynamically links SDL and/or Xlib.

2. `sdl-fakeqwerty` is intended to correct a defect which limits utility of software that uses SDL and/or Xlib, and is not a "mod" of a specific game.

3. `sdl-fakeqwerty` may be considered a derivative work of SDL or Xorg; in such a case it is likely impossible to grant unencumbered rights or privileges over this work in the way that many "mod policies" would demand in excess of its existing licenses.

Owing to the above points, _even in the case that [this tool supports a game](./games/prison_architect.md) now published by such a publisher:_

* **no additional rights** to this work are granted to such publishers, other than what is granted under this software's regular licenses.

* **no additional restrictions** are accepted from such publishers -- even in the case they may not be contravened today.

* **we believe such clauses to be entirely unenforceable.**
